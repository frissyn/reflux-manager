# Reflux Manager

Simple Python script I use to manage and build my [Reflux](https://github.com/frissyn/Reflux) themes. Built for personal use, but anyone can easily fork and tweak to suit thier needs.

**How to use:**

1. Fork and/or clone the respository.
2. Delete and create a new `themes/` directory.
3. To create a new theme, make a new folder with the theme title and a `theme.yaml` file.
4. Run the script with `python setup.py` to upload your themes and build them.
5. View the output in each theme's `build/` directory.

That's it! You can have as many themes as you want, and running the script will upload and build all your themes. The `build/` contains the theme's referral code, raw CSS stylesheet, and bookmarklet script if you want a standalone theme bookmarklet.
